# Student Course Registration System (Java Console Application)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a *Java-based console application* developed as part of my internship at *Info Bharat Interns*.  
The system simulates a *Student Course Registration System*, where students can register, courses can be added, and enrollments can be managed.

The goal of this project is to *apply core Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles* and implement a real-world problem scenario using clean and modular code.
